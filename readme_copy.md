###Repository for coursework in Data Scientist Toolbox MOOC

I hope to sucessfully complete the Data Scientist Toolbox course and the Data Scientist specialisation.
This is my first effort at using GitHub and my first real exposure to programming

So far I have learned:
* How to set up Git
* How to set up GitHub and create a repo
* repo is short for repository
* create forks, make changes, move things from local system to remote system
* merge forks
* Some simple markdown editing techniques such as headings and lists


Thanks for your interest.
